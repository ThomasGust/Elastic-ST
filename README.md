# STLasso
A python data science library to create sparse coefficient matrices from spatial transcriptomics data.

# Installation
Leaving this blank for now, none of the libraries are super exotic so it should hopefully distribute really easily once it is up on Pypi.

# Features
STLasso offers a several features to build off of existing analysis tools for spatial transcriptomics data:

1. Compute basic spatial statistics to better characterize spatially variable genes in your data such as:
  * Moran's I
  * Gearys C
  * Getis-Ord Gi*
  * Ripley's K
  * Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation
  * Dispersion Index
  * Between Gene Spatial Cross Correlation
  * Spatial Co-Occurence
  * Mark Correlation Function
  * Bivariate Moran's I
  * Spatial Eigenvector Mapping
