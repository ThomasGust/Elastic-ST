# STLaso
A python data science library to create sparse coefficient matrices from spatial transcriptomics data.

# Installation
Leaving this blank for now, none of the libraries are super exotic so it should hopefully distribute really easily once it is up on Pypi.

# Examples

`import st-lasso as stl`
